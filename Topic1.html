        <h1>How Cookies Shape Privacy in the Modern Web</h1>
        <div class="section">

                    It seems like you go to a site, and the site somehow remembers you, who you are, 
                what you ordered on your cart, what theme you use, or that you have already closed a 
                pop-up that you did not want. Websites accomplish this in a form known as cookies. 
                A cookie is simply a small text that is saved on your browser by a site. Although they have 
                been tiny and modest, these tiny notes are what render the present-day websites appear customized 
                as well as functional. There are cookies that disappear as long as you are on a site and cookies 
                that remain in your computer much longer to make the site familiar with you the next time you visit it. 
                In most situations cookies are very useful, particularly when they remember important issues such as your 
                session such that you do not find yourself having to log in again and again.The privacy issues start when 
                cookies are not utilized because of convenience. There are companies that incorporate third-party cookies 
                into websites and this implies that a person can be being tracked not only on one site but on a large number 
                of sites. These cookies may gradually create an accurate image of your habits: which articles you were reading, 
                what products you were about to purchase, how much time you spend scrolling, which content you like. This is 
                something that most of the people do not witness directly, and thus this makes it a point of concern. 
                It feels awkward to consider the possibility of other businesses you have not even communicated with, 
                constructing a profile of your online actions. Due to this reason, there has been a call to have more
                privacy protection. The GDPR, as applied in the European Union, mandates websites to obtain explicit consent 
                before installing some cookies on your computer. That is why you see lots of such cookie banners as soon as you 
                open lots of websites. Such laws attempt to provide individuals with greater authority over the kind of data they 
                desire sites to store information about them - as well as the information that they would rather remain confidential. 
                It is a part of a bigger movement to make data collection more open, as opposed to a process that occurs in the background. Security 
                wise cookies must also be treated well. A cookie may have a session ID that identifies you as having been logged in and in case that 
                cookie were to be stolen, somebody would impersonate you. To avoid this, websites should introduce security to cookies that limit 
                their dissemination or access. It is possible to label cookies to only use trusted HTTPS connections, and to block 
                cookies being read by the JavaScript to minimize theft chances. These are technical safeguards, which mitigate the 
                vulnerabilities, but they do not eliminate the privacy concerns related to long-range tracking. This proves that cookies 
                are not wicked per se - they are merely tools. They facilitate websites when utilized in a disciplined manner, and make 
                them easier and more enjoyable. They might destroy privacy in a manner that most individuals are not anticipating when 
                they are used in an untransparent manner. The knowledge of cookies assists us to comprehend why this issue of privacy 
                needs to be taken seriously over the Internet and why contemporary web pages must decide between customization and 
                privacy of user information. ///////// Upon visiting a web site, you forget the extent of the activity that is going on in the background. 
                You can open pages in seconds, your account is automatically logged in, and the products in your cart do not lose their 
                color, and your language preferences are the same as they were yesterday. None of this comes easy--it comes as a result 
                of something known as cookies. A cookie is a small file that is stored in your browser which enables a site to store 
                insignificant amounts of information about you. Although it is tiny and nearly invisible, a cookie is a massive 
                contributor to a feeling of convenience and customization of the internet. Without cookies, you would need to log in 
                each and every time you open a site, your preferences would not be saved, and most of the things that happen everyday 
                just would not work as we expect them to. The complex phase starts when cookies start to go past mere convenience, 
                and start defining your digital identity on the internet. Some of the websites that you visit contain advertisement 
                network, analytics or other social media sites. When their third-party services add their cookies they are able to 
                follow up on your behavior not only in a single site but also in a large number of sites. In the long run, this brings 
                about an unexpectedly rich image of your behavior, what you purchase, what videos you view, what articles you read at
                night, where you can click, how long you spend on a page, even what mood you may be in, depending on your browsing 
                behavior patterns. What is particularly worrying about this is that the majority of the individuals are not even aware 
                that it happens, and they never gave their express consent in order to have their behavior monitored that closely. This increased 
                awareness has brought the issue of privacy to the limelight. Individuals are posing more difficult questions: Who is 
                receiving this data? How long do they keep it? What are they doing with it? And, most of all,--Why do they ever know 
                so much about me at all? These are the questions that have caused significant reforms across the globe. They started 
                designing regulations in order to ensure that websites are more transparent with regard to the collection of information.
                This is the reason why cookie banners have become so ubiquitous. Even though a lot of users pass over the Accept All 
                button without thinking, it is the intent of such banners to ensure that individuals have an option on how much 
                information they are comfortable disclosing. These prompts can be seen as a move in the direction of increased user 
                control, although the execution of this can be cumbersome or irritating. Cookies are also vulnerable to cyberattacks in 
                case a person does not treat them properly with regard to security. To take an example, a session cookie, which is used 
                to remember your login, may enable an attacker to impersonate you in case it is stolen. The developers have features 
                such as transmitted cookies, such as only over a secure HTTPS connection or preventing their reading by JavaScript. 
                These security measures do not completely eliminate risks but chances of a person taking over your online identity are 
                minimized. It reminds you that cookies are not only about privacy but they are also closely related to the confidence
                that you feel when you are on the web. All these demonstrate the complexity that the role of cookies has attained. 
                They facilitate the daily surfing process and are even more entertaining but at the same time, they gripe about the 
                extent to which companies understand us. They are capable of safeguarding your session, at the same time revealing 
                your behavior. They enhance your experience, yet may spoil on your anonymity. It is not the cookies that are good or 
                bad, but just the means. The issue is what their use is intended, and whether users are provided with a real-life 
                control over their personal data. With the increase in population education on privacy, expectations have changed. 
                Users desire customization, and not spying. They desire convenience, without having to lose control of their digital 
                life. Sites which are open with their practices and those which respect the will of the users are gaining more and more 
                credibility as the sites that are secretive in their practices continue to be criticized. In the future, the issue of 
                personalization versus privacy will remain one of the most characteristic aspects of the new web. The initial means of 
                walking that balance more comfortably is to learn about cookies: how they assist us, and how they may cross the line.
