                Cookies are small fragments of data that are stored in your 
                browser by websites that could remember stuff about you. This
                could be your status of being logged in, the product(s) in your 
                shopping cart or that you like dark mode. Cookies are what make 
                sites in the internet feel easier and personal, yet they may gather 
                more information than individuals may even think about it. Due to that, 
                they have become a significant aspect of the debate on online privacy.
