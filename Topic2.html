        <h1>Privacy Regulation and Changing the Landscape of Web Tracking</h1>
        <div class="section">
            <p>
                    With the growing debate on the issue of digital privacy, cookies have risen to form the centre 
                of discussion over the rights of data and surveillance on the internet. What was initially a simple 
                feature that was implemented to assist websites in not forgetting who you are has evolved into an 
                exceptionally effective tracking device that can create extremely detailed profiles of individual 
                users. The companies are now able to use cookies to discover what will interest, the habits, the 
                shopping behavior of the user and even his behavior on completely different websites. Such kind of 
                cross-site tracking became so common that most of the people were not even aware of the fact that so 
                much information was being gathered in the background. Behavioral advertising, data brokers, and 
                algorithmic targeting made the issue even more acute, forcing governments and privacy activists to 
                insist on more explicit regulations regarding how data is collected and what rights users need to the 
                information they possess themselves. To address these anxieties, some of the key legislations 
                have changed how websites treat cookies and personal information. The most powerful of them is the 
                General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union that requires websites to clearly 
                notify users about the information that is gathered and seek their consent prior to installing 
                unnecessary cookies on their computers. Users should have simple options, not general warnings, 
                under GDPR, regarding the type of tracking to which they agree. Likewise, the California Consumer 
                Privacy Act (CCPA) and its amendment the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) provide users with 
                access to their data collection by companies, the possibility to request the data be deleted, and the 
                most significant right of the latter to opt out of the sale or transfer of their data. Such 
                legislations made businesses reconsider the way they utilize cookies and promoted more transparent 
                data policies. The rise of cookie banners is one of the most glaring effects of these regulations, 
                i.e. the pop-ups that appear the first thing you open a website. Although they are irritating to many 
                users, they are a step to an internet that is more consent-based. Users can now have direct control on 
                the kind of data that a given site can access. There are those which have straightforward Accept all
                buttons and those with detailed panels that allow the user to select which cookies to reject analytics, 
                advertising cookies or performance tracking. This system, despite its flaws, tries to provide people 
                with increased control over their presence on the Internet. In addition to legislative efforts, the 
                large web browsers have also intervened to curb the practice of invasive tracking. Other browsers 
                like Safari and Firefox became some of the earliest to default third party cookies, cutting a 
                significant source of cross-site tracking. Google Chrome that previously relied heavily on third-party 
                cookies as part of its advertising infrastructure has also stated that it will be eliminating them too. 
                This is a massive change in the way the advertising business is conducted. As third party cookies 
                are phased out, businesses are scrambling to come up with alternatives of tracking users in a less 
                invasive and more respectful way to privacy. There have been suggested alternatives such as interest 
                groups that are represented through a browser, anonymous signals, or contextual advertisements which 
                are based on the content of the page rather than the person. Nonetheless, the new tools also cast 
                doubt on the possibility of these new tools that tracking will be more non-invasive or just develops 
                in less noticeable forms. Meanwhile, the privacy issue does not start and end with cookies. 
                A lot of websites are currently basing on device fingerprinting, IP tracking and browser profiling 
                among other methods that do not require cookies at all. Such practices may be more difficult to 
                identify or manage on the part of users and this is why privacy activists have express the opinion 
                that outlawing third-party cookies is just a fraction of a larger issue. The biggest problem is in 
                striking a balance between the privacy of users, the business requirements, and the individual 
                experiences that people have become used to over the internet. Whereas some say that targeted 
                advertisements keep the websites free and relevant, some say that convenience should not be compromised 
                at the expense of privacy. Finally, the future of cookies and online tracking remains probably to be 
                determined by a mix of technology, regulation, and expectations of the users. Citizens are increasingly 
                becoming conscious of the way their information is gathered and they are asserting more control. 
                Corporations, in their turn, are getting to know that transparency is not only a legal obligation 
                but an asset in competition-customers will trust the websites that do not infringe on their privacy. 
                With the advent of new tools and standards, there is a possibility of the internet moving towards the
                paradigm of personalization still occurring but not done through constant surveillance. The result, 
                be it the creation of a more personalized and secure web, or just the invention of new types of 
                surveillance under the guise of betterment, will be a decision of the developers, policymakers, 
                and tech industry within the coming years.
