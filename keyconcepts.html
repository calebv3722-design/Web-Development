            <h2>Cookies</h2>
                <p>
                    Cookies are small fragments of data that are stored in your 
                    browser by websites that could remember stuff about you. This
                    could be your status of being logged in, the product(s) in your 
                    shopping cart or that you like dark mode. Cookies are what make 
                    sites in the internet feel easier and personal, yet they may gather 
                    more information than individuals may even think about it. Due to that, 
                    they have become a significant aspect of the debate on online privacy.

            <h2>Session State</h2>
                <p>
                    Session state is simply the memory that a web site uses when you are browsing 
                    it. In fact, when you are browsing across various pages with a logged in user, 
                    then something must identify to the web site who you are, and that is generally 
                    a session cookie. With no session state, websites would remember you even as soon 
                    as you left the site. It is very handy, however, it has to be secured well since a 
                    session stealer may impersonate you.

        <h2>First-Party vs. Third-Party Cookies</h2>
            <p>
                Cookies do not all work in the same way. First-party cookies are the ones issued 
                by the very site where you are visiting and tend to assist with various activities 
                such as maintaining login. Third-party cookies are however cookies placed on the site 
                by third-party companies, usually advertisers or tracking services. These cookies are 
                able to track your activity on various websites and this is what has led to a lot of 
                privacy concerns about them hence many browsers currently block them.

        <h2>Online Tracking</h2>
            <p>
                Online tracking occurs when online companies track your activities on the internet by 
                using cookies or other cookies like these. Gradually they are capable of creating an 
                amazingly elaborate portrait of your life, what you are buying, what you are reading, 
                even when you are likely to be online. Tracking may make your online experience more 
                personal at times, although it brings up the question, to what extent should companies 
                actually know you?

        <h2>Cookie Security Features</h2>
            <p>
                It is possible to make cookies safer with several significant settings. Indicatively, 
                the Secure environment ensures that the cookie is exchanged over encrypted HTTPS connections. 
                HttpOnly stores cookies in a way that they cannot be accessed by JavaScript so that they cannot
                be stolen by hackers easily. And SameSite can determine whether or not a cookie can be sent, in 
                case of another site and this can save you against some forms of attack. These features do not 
                eliminate all the problems, but they will go a long way in ensuring that your information is safe.

        <h2>Privacy Laws (GDPR, CCPA)</h2>
            <p>
                With the increased attention people began taking towards the collection and use of their data, 
                new privacy laws were implemented by governments. GDPR in Europe makes sites describe their 
                collection of data and seek consent prior to using any non-essential data such as advertising 
                cookies. In California, other laws such as CCPA give the users the authority to find out what
                data is being gathered, and even command that companies destroy it. These legislations are 
                attempting to provide the populace with an increased influence in an online world where profiling 
                has been a customary experience.

        <h2>User Acceptance and Openness</h2>
            <p>
               Due to the issue of privacy and emerging laws, websites have become far more transparent regarding 
                their use of cookies. This is why there are such a high number of cookie pop-ups when you open a 
                site. They are not those irritating screens but are designed to provide you with an option on what 
                data you feel comfortable disclosing. Users are less controlled and feel that their actions on the 
                internet are taken into consideration when websites are transparent and truthful about their way of 
                data use.
